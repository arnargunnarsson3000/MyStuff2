Installing may be kind of awkward.

Needed python packages:
    matplotlib
    sqlite3

The INSTALL.py adds 'engineer' to path, if INSTALL.py is broken,
    add PARENT directory of folder that engineer is save in to path
        e.g.: engineer save in downloads then add downloads to path, not downloads/engineer

A video renderer is required, this has been tested using FFMPEG
    ffmpeg
